## 📌 Key Features

* **Data Downloading**: How to download the Data from ChEMBL for Lung Cancer BioAssays for Active and Inactive classes.
* **Analysing & Processing the Files**: How to analyse the correctness of the downloaded data and process it.
* **Removing Duplicates and Adding Activity**: How to remove duplicates and add Activity (1 for Active, 0 for Inactive) for any type of processing.
* **Output-Ready Results**: Generates ready-to-use SDF files for the docking and other downstream analysis and validation, and plots the figures for RMSD, RMSF and MMGBSA generated by Desmond.
